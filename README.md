# OpenPolytechNZ_BIT591TM2
BIT 591 TM 2 repo for document collaboration , part of Open Polytech of NZ course, experiment

I've set this up for an experiment in collaboration, comparing using Github versus Google Apps for Education.
As the online forum discussion draws to a conclusion there is a consensus that we will use GA for E for the course.

I posted a suggestion that those wishing to use Github, or upskill, we could run a comparitive trial as an extra aside to the course. If there's any takers I will activate them as collaborators on this public repo.
